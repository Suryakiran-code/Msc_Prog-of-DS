Exercise 1. Write a Python function that converts a distance in miles to a distance in
kilometres. Note that one mile is exactly 25146/15625 km.
Exercise 2. Write a Python function that takes three inputs (the number of hours since
midnight, the number of minutes in the hour, and the number of seconds in the minute)
and returns the number of seconds since midnight.
Group activity/discussion. Complex numbers are numbers of the form given below (in
Python). Notice we have 1j and 4j not 1*j and 4*j. Here j is NOT a variable.
u = 0+1j
z = 3+4j
print(u,' and ',z)
(a) Write Python code to find the type of 𝑢 and 𝑧 in Python?
(b) What is 𝑢 × 𝑢? How is this useful? Investigate −𝑢 × −𝑢 and see if that is also
interpretable.
(c) Compare 𝑢 + 𝑧 and 𝑧 + 𝑢. Also compare 𝑢 × 𝑧 and 𝑧 × 𝑢. What can you conclude?
(d) Let e = 1+0j and then investigate 𝑒 × 𝑧 and 𝑧 × 𝑒. What can you conclude?
(e) Can you use + and * with a mixture of integers or floats and complex numbers?

Exercise 1. Suppose that the current date is given in a Python string in the form
DD/MM/YYYY. Write Python code using string indexing to print out the date in the form
DD Month YYYY, e.g., 20/09/2023 would be printed out as 20 September 2023. Write
further Python code using the string method split() to do the same task without string
indexing. Hint: You might consider using if-elif-else or a list of strings.

Exercise 2. Suppose you have an automatic wildlife camera. You want the camera to switch
on if the light level is low (less than 0.01 lux) or if the temperature is above freezing, but not
if both conditions are True. Write Python code to check these conditions and print a
message when the camera switches on.

Exercise 3. Write Python code using integer division to convert a given whole number of
minutes into a list consisting of whole number of days, hours and minutes. For example,
3456 minutes should result in [2, 9, 36], i.e., 2 days, 9 hours and 36 minutes.
Group Challenge. Write a Python function to check whether a given string has the same
number of ‘x’s and ‘o’s. The function must return a Boolean value and be case insensitive.
The given string can contain any characters.
Exercise 4. The characters in a Python string are UTF-8 characters (not just ASCII). The
Python code below defines the six different Chess pieces using UTF-8 characters. Write
Python code to print out the starting chessboard shown below.
king = '\u265A'
queen = '\u265B'
rook = '\u265C'
bishop = '\u265D'
knight = '\u265E'
pawn = '\u265F
